# Setting Things Up

**NOTE: The entire Python chapter is a shortened version of the tutorials in the [psy111 course](https://mibur1.github.io/psy111/). Feel free to check this out in case you need more detailed explanations for some topics.**

All exercises in the Python section can be used directly within the browser through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). You can open them by clicking on the Rocket icon in the top bar once you opened an exercise session in this book. 

However, the individual Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) can also be opened and run on your local computer. As this is a must for computationally expensive analyses, we will start with setting up a working Python environment on your own computer.
