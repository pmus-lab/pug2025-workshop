# Data Types and Strucutures

The Python programming language is a *general purpose* language, which means it is widely used in many fields, including statistics and neuroimaging. Python is a *high-level, interpreted* language, which means it offers a high level of abstraction and you do not need to worry about *low-level* things like memory management.

While the main content of this seminar revolves around multivariate statistics, I hope that this book and its tutorials will not only teach you some practical statistical skills, but also will spark the joy of programming within you. Initially, programming languages like Python might seem daunting, but they are incredibly powerful tools for working with all types of data. Mastering any kind of programming language can be a game-changer, enabling you to transform your future scientific ideas into reality. I therefore stongly encourage you to keep up with the materials covered in the seminar, and maybe even to explore some small additional projects which you are interested in. With that being said, let's get right into it!

:class: note

Some of the contents covered in the *Introduction to Python* part of the seminar were inspired by the the book *"Data Science for Neuroimaging: An Introduction"* by Ariel Rokem and Tal Yarkoni {cite}`Rokem2023`, which is [freely available online](https://neuroimaging-data-science.org). Further, you will also find a plethora of tutorials, questions, and answers related to Python on the internet. Some suggestions are listed in the [additional reading](../misc/reading) section.
